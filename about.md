***Due to COVID-19, the Gardens are closed until regular campus access is
restored.***

Our Community Garden is open to members of the Standards Employee Benefits
Association (SEBA) including employees, guest researchers and associates of the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). You can read about how
the Community Garden came into being [here][origin].

Each garden plot is 3 m × 3 m (10 ft × 10 ft) and costs $30 for a year. Organic
practices are required in the garden; read the detailed [SEBA Gardens Rules][rules].
If you would like to join after reviewing the Rules, please complete and return
the [SEBA Gardens Membership Form][membership].

Please [contact us][contact] with any questions or comments you may have.
