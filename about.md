Our Community Garden is open to members of the Standards Employee Benefits
Association (SEBA) including employees, guest researchers and associates of the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). If you are interested in
our origins, please read about [how the Community Garden came into being][origin].

Each garden plot is 3 m × 3 m (10 ft × 10 ft) and costs $30 per year. Organic
practices are required in the garden; read the detailed [SEBA Gardens
Rules][rules]. If you would like to join after reviewing the Rules, please
complete and return the [SEBA Gardens Membership Form][membership].

Please [contact us][contact] with any questions or comments you may
have, and/or join the [SEBA Gardens Mailing List][listserv].

#### Location

SEBA Gardens are located near the F Gate: see the map below. The surrounding
area is undergoing meadowland restoration: **do not drive up to the Gardens**
unless you have heavy materials to drop off. Park in the small area off the
gravel road leading up to the site, and enjoy your relaxing stroll the rest of
the way.

Ticks are a natural part of meadowlands, so [please take precautions][ticks]
when you visit.
