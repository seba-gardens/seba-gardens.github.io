Our Community Garden is open to members of the Standards Employee Benefits
Association (SEBA) including employees, guest researchers and associates of the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). You can read about how
the Community Garden came into being [here][origin].

Each garden plot is 3 m × 3 m (10 ft × 10 ft) and costs $30 for a year. Organic
practices are required in the garden; read the detailed [SEBA Gardens Rules][rules].

The Gardens are closed until regular campus access is restored. Please [contact
us][contact] with any questions or comments you may have.
