In 2015, Emily Townsend had a soil sample (5 in deep) tested by the
University of Delaware Cooperative Extension [Soil Testing Lab].
A summary of the results follows.

## Lead

The concentration of lead (Pb) was measured at 33 parts per million in the
garden soil. Per the report,

> Soil lead concentration is at background level and well below the
> recommended limit of 400 parts per million in the soil.
>
> To minimize exposure to any lead present, follow good hygiene practices
> during and after handling the soil.

## pH

The garden soil had pH 5.0 (acidic).

> Maintain a soil pH of 6.5 or higher to reduce availability of any lead
> present. To raise soil pH to the desired level, apply 100 lbs of ground
> limestone per 1000 square feet. Monitor soil nutrient levels as good
> fertility will minimize the uptake of lead by plants.
>
> If growing acid loving plants (e.g., blueberries, azaleas), raising soil
> pH to 6.5 may result in poor plant growth. You may wish to maintain a
> lower soil pH but follow other mentioned practices to minimize exposure
> to any lead present.

## Nutrient Composition

The report provides "index values," where 100 indicates "optimal" and
values above that are "excessive." The garden soil indices were:

| ___Element___ | ___Name___   | ___Index___ | ___Level___ |
| ---           | ---          | ---         | ---         |
| P             | Phosphorus   |   6         | Low         |
| K             | Potassium    |  56         | Medium      |
| Mg            | Magnesium    |  94         | Optimal     |
| Ca            | Calcium      |  62         | Optimal     |

The report also provides a bar chart for at-a-glance interpretation:

``` output
         ┏━━━━━━┥LOW┝━━━━━━┥MEDIUM┝━━━━━┥OPTIMAL┝━━━━┥EXCESS┝━━┓
P index  ┫*** 6                                                ┃
K index  ┫********************** 56                            ┃
Mg index ┫************************************* 94             ┃
Ca index ┫************************ 62                          ┃
         ┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛
```

Compositions of a few more elements were also reported in units of "pounds
per acre" as follows (sulfate is a source of sulfur, S):

| ___Element___ | ___Name___  | ___Amount___ |
| ---           | ---         | ---          |
| B             | Boron       |   0.7        |
| Mn            | Manganese   |  35.6        |
| Zn            | Zinc        |   4.2        |
| S/SO₄         | Sulfur/-ate |  36.0        |

### Miscellaneous Data

* 3.9% organic matter
* 5.8% phosphorus saturation
* 54.9% base saturation
* 8.0 mg per 100 g cation exchange capacity (CEC)
* Buffer pH 7.55

## Fertilizer Program

The report closes with the following recommendation:

1. Apply 75 lbs ground limestone per 1000 square feet and work in by
   spading, plowing, or tilling.
2. Apply 4 lbs triple superphosphate (0-46-0) per 1000 square feet and work
   in to the top 4 to 6 inches of the soil by spading, plowing, or tilling.
3. Apply 20 lbs 5-10-5 or equivalent water soluble fertilizer to the soil
   surface and rake in just before planting.

## Action Taken

Lime was spread on all plots based on the report's recommendations.
