All the weeds in our plots are holding soil nutrients in their stems, leaves,
flowers, etc. So they work a little bit like a cover crop in that sense. If you
kill them they will release nutrients as they decompose. But weeds are harder
to get rid of than a cover crop. Some of them go to seed in just a few weeks,
so you have new weeds trying to crowd out your veggies all season long. Some of
them spread by creeping along the ground, invading your whole plot. Maybe they
just grow really quickly. Or maybe they can re-root or go to seed after you
have pulled them and left them to die on the ground. We call them weeds when
they have a way of showing up uninvited. Some of them are edible, if you want
to exact your revenge personally.

### Austrian Winter Peas

A cover crop we planted in many of the plots last fall. The tender shoots are
edible and taste like peas. You can stir-fry them with a little oil, garlic and
salt. They are a legume, which means their roots harbor bacteria that turn
nitrogen from the air into fertilizer in the soil. The plant uses that
fertilizer to build its stems and leaves. When it decomposes in the ground, the
nitrogen becomes available for your vegetable plants. If we wait til it flowers
and then mow it down to the ground, it is supposed to die completely.

### Winter Wheat

A cover crop we planted in many of the plots last fall. It keeps nutrients from
washing out of the soil by building its leaves with them. When it decomposes in
the ground those nutrients are added back and the organic matter helps the soil
structure and feeds beneficial microorganisms. If we wait til it starts to have
seed heads and then mow it down to the ground, it is supposed to die
completely. If you want to till before then, pull it out or it will get tangled
in the tiller.

### Clover

The smaller clover is white clover, the larger is crimson clover. It was
planted as a cover crop in earlier years, and is still growing some places in
our garden. It is a legume, so it also hosts bacteria that turn atmospheric
nitrogen into fertilizer available to plants. When it blooms it attracts
pollinators who will help your tomatoes, peppers, and [most other vegetables](

set fruit.

### Vetch

This is a cover crop plant that we didn’t plant this year, but as a legume, it
fixes nitrogen. It also attracts bees and other beneficial insects.

### Chickweed

### Dead Nettle

An edible weed. Called “dead” because it doesn’t sting. The ones with purple
leaves and flowers are the dead nettle. There is chickweed growing below it in
this picture.

### Long-leaf Plantain

Sort-of edible.

### Wild Allium
