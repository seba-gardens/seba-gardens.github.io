SEBA Gardens is migrating from the old Google Sites backend to
GitHub Pages using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). A demo
website is up at <https://seba-gardens.github.io>. In the
process, some changes have been made:

* Replaced the aerial photo of the site with a live Google map.
* Created a portrait gallery of our Executive Committee members.
* Generated "news posts" from the archives:
  * [History of SEBA Gardens](/general/2016/07/27/History-of-NIST-Community-Garden/)
  * [Overview of the common weeds and cover crops in the garden](/general/2017/04/14/Whats-in-My-Plot/)
  * [Design and operation of the solar water tank](/general/2018/04/20/Water-Tank/)
* Transcribed the [SEBA Gardens Rules and Bylaws](/governance/SEBA-Gardens-Rules/).
