By Trevor Keller, *Volunteer Coordinator*

As the NIST Campus re-opens and permission is granted to come on-site by
default, we are pleased to announce the return of Volunteer Work parties!
There is a lot of work to do, as the Garden has been closed for more than two
years. As we work to revitalize our plots, the two most significant challenges
are:

1. Cleaning the tool shed and everything in it of rodent debris.
2. Clearing the plots of objects and large weeds that will interfere with plowing.

***Please join us:***

- 1:00 to 4:00 PM on Saturday, 14 May, 2022
- 5:00 to 6:45 PM on Wednesday, 18 May, 2022

***Take safety precautions:***

- The tool shed is an enclosed space that has been occupied by rodents. Please
  [plan to wear gloves, bleachable clothing, and a mask][rodents] if you plan
  to help clear it.
- The meadowlands around the Garden have grown to about 30 cm (1 ft) tall:
  [please take precautions against ticks][ticks] to avoid bringing a passenger
  home.

Hope to see you soon!
