***SEBA Gardens is currently closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We anticipate
re-opening once regular site access is restored.***

SEBA Gardens is a community garden on the grounds of the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, MD: please see the map below.
We officially opened for gardening in Spring of 2016 after a year of hard work
by volunteers who raised funds and prepared the site for gardening.

If you are interested in having a plot, please review the
[SEBA Gardens Rules](/governance/SEBA-Gardens-Rules/) and complete the 
[SEBA Gardens Membership Form](/governance/SEBA_Gardens_Membership_Form.pdf).
