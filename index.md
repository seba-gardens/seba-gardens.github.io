SEBA Gardens is a community garden on the grounds of the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, MD: please see the map below.
We officially opened for gardening in Spring of 2016 after a year of hard work
by volunteers who raised funds and prepared the site for gardening,
and re-opened with the rest of the NIST Gaithersburg campus in Spring of 2022.

If you are interested in having a plot, please review the
[SEBA Gardens Rules](/governance/SEBA-Gardens-Rules/) and complete the
[SEBA Gardens Membership Form](/governance/SEBA_Gardens_Membership_Form.pdf).
