\emph{Welcome!} Thank you for your interest in gardening at SEBA~Gardens,
the NIST campus community garden. Please use this form to reserve
or renew one or more {\bf 3\,{m}\,{×}\,{3}\,{m}}
(10\,{ft}\,{×}\,{10}\,{ft}) plots, each \textbf{\${30}} per year. Your
plot fee covers maintenance and shared resources: seeds, tools, shed,
water tank, \emph{etc}. Because SEBA~Gardens is chartered by
\href{https://inet.nist.gov/do/deio/seba}{SEBA}, gardeners need to be SEBA
members: please enroll if you have not already done so this year.

In the space below, please provide your name, phone number, and preferred email
address for gardening-related business. If you are sharing your plot with
other gardeners (SEBA members), please provide their info as well.\\[2pt]
