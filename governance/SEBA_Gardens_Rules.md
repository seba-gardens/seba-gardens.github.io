### Gardening Rules and Guidelines

* **Organic practices are required in all parts of the Gardens.** Garden pests
  and plant diseases can be especially serious in the community garden setting.
  Gardeners are expected to monitor their plants and plots for signs of pest
  problems and plant diseases. Only organic methods such as handpicking bugs,
  row covers, etc., can be used in the community garden. Anyone of the garden
  committee can help you locate information about controlling pests, treating
  and/or removing diseased plants.
* **Gardeners are expected to help with community garden chores.** These
  include weeding and chipping common areas, fence lines, and paths, keeping
  the garden trash-free, and other garden tasks as requested by the Executive
  Committee.
* Each gardener is responsible for weeding, cultivating, and/or watering their
  plot(s), and must arrange for someone to maintain the garden plot if away for
  an extended period of time. By **May 1**, gardeners must begin work on their
  plots including weeding, soil amendment, and cultivation. By **June 1**,
  gardeners must have planted seeds, seedlings, or transplants in their plots.
  Gardeners must remove dead plants and summer garden debris from plots by the
  date announced by the Executive Committee, typically in early October.
* All gardens are subject to regular inspections. If a garden plot is not in
  compliance with the established rules, the plot can be revoked. See the SEBA
  Gardens Rules on Probation for full details about the process.
* **To reduce weeds and pests,** improve the soil, and maintain the garden’s
  appearance, mulch is strongly recommended. Gardeners are encouraged use
  materials such as aged compost, composted manure, leaves, straw, burlap, weed
  cloth, layers of newspaper, or plastic (away from lawn areas) to protect the
  soil and reduce weeds.
* **Gardeners are strongly encouraged to plant fall and winter crops.** If not,
  they should take steps to protect the soil by planting cover crops or
  covering their plots with barriers to reduce winter weeds. Acceptable
  barriers include newspaper (non-shiny parts) covered with mulch or compost,
  burlap bags, weed cloth, plastic covering or tarps.
* **Invasive plants are not allowed.** Aggressive plants like mint, lemon balm,
  strawberry and similar plants must be grown in containers and should not be
  allowed to get established in other parts of the garden.
* Gardeners must control weeds in their plots, especially before the weeds go
  to seed or otherwise invade neighboring plots and paths. Wiregrass is
  especially invasive and problematic, aggressively spreading via rhizomes
  (roots) in the ground. Gardeners are required to remove wiregrass from their
  plots **and the paths around their plots.**
* **Water conservation must be practiced at all times.** Please concentrate on
  watering roots rather than other parts of the plants. Gardeners must be
  present when watering. Do NOT leave water running unattended. Direct watering
  (from hose to ground) is not allowed in order to conserve our limited water
  resource. Open containers of water are not allowed for health-related
  reasons. If you wish to keep water in your plot, containers must be kept
  covered when not in use.
* **Plant supports or stakes are allowed but cannot exceed six feet or shade
  adjoining plots.** No structures of any kind can be built without approval by
  the SEBA gardens committee.
* **Fences up to 1 foot high** may be installed in your garden inside the plot
  boundaries. The materials should be neutral in color and should not create
  tripping or other safety hazards.

### Getting Along and Courtesy in the Gardens

* **In general, all NIST campus rules remain in effect in the Gardens.**
* Every **damage to the main fence** surrounding the community gardens should be
  reported immediately to anyone of the SEBA garden Executive Committee.
* The fence doors should be **kept shut at ALL times** to prevent any wild
  animal from entering.
* If any **wild animal** is entering or found on the Garden grounds reasonable
  action should be taken to scare it away. If this is not successful contact
  any one of the SEBA garden committee.
* **Gardeners are not allowed to trap animals** (such as groundhogs, raccoons,
  etc.) in the Community Gardens at any time, except with prior approval of the
  President or Treasurer.
* **Parking near and driving to the Gardens** is limited to bringing heavy
  and/or large garden supplies to the garden.
* **Littering and dumping are forbidden.** The Gardens are trash-free, carry-in
  and carry-out facilities. Only plant waste is allowed in the compost areas.
  All trash must be removed from the site and disposed of by the gardeners.
* Gardeners are not permitted to borrow or move tools, wheelbarrows, etc.,
  without the express permission of the owner.
* **Children are welcome in the garden** as long they have obtained appropriate
  authorization for entry onto NIST property and are accompanied and supervised
  by an adult.
* The community gardens are **alcohol- and smoke-free.**

### SEBA Gardens Rules on Probation

In our first year (Summer 2016), we had a nice success: Many vegetables and
flowers, some really beautiful plots, and a few excellent examples of people
doing a great job of “wintering over” their plots. However, a significant
number of people either i) abandoned their plots, or ii) did not clear their
plots at the end of the Summer; these actions cause a large increase in the
weed load for all Gardeners and create significant additional burden for all of
us. For these reasons, we have implemented a more formal process of probation.
We wish to offer a combination of i) encouragement and assistance, by offering
a Mentor and ii) enforcement mechanisms.

In the event of Garden Plot misuse or abandonment, a probationary period and
revocation of the plot will follow for the gardener.

Probationary status is assigned if any of the following conditions occur:

1. **End‐of‐Season (EOS) clean‐up is not performed for previous planting
   season.** Garden must be cleared of all plants and ground must be prepared
   for the cover crop (cover crop arrangements can be made on an individual
   basis). Any additional EOS tasks assigned by the SEBA Gardens Committee must
   also be completed; these tasks will be assigned using the SEBA Gardens
   member e‐mail.
2. **Monthly Garden Plot check finds the garden is not in good condition two
   times in a row.** Monthly Garden Plot checks will occur on each Garden Work
   Day during the planting season (April‐September.) 
   
   A first offense will result in
   1. an email warning with details of what is unacceptable about the plot, and
   2. an offer to assign a Mentor.
   
   A second offense will result in the member being placed on probation.

#### Failed Probation

Probation failure occurs when a member who is on probation fails a Garden Plot
check. Failed probation results in the following:

1. revocation of the plot for the rest of the season, and
2. the following year the member will not be allowed to have a plot, and
3. the second following year the member will be on probation for the entire
   planting season.

#### Mentors (if available)

The Garden Committee will assign a mentor. The member will meet with their
mentor about once per week in the garden in order to receive encouragement,
advice and assistance. We hope this encouragement will help the member to
recover a productive plot and avoid the consequences of probation.
