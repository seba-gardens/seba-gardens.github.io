# SEBA Gardens Website

<http://www.sebagardens.org>

This repository contains the source code used to build the static SEBA Gardens
website. It leans on the [Alembic](https://alembic.darn.es/) remote theme for
Jekyll created & maintained by [David Darnes](https://github.com/daviddarnes).
This means we can focus on the content rather than the layout.
